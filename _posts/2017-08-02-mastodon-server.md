As something of an experiment, I've opened up a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) server for
Pdgn. Signups currently require a pdgn.co email (another service I added without mentioning it!),
but I might change this as time goes on. You can visit the Mastodon site at
[goura.pdgn.co](https://goura.pdgn.co). If you haven't already heard of it, Mastodon is a federated
social network using OStatus (like [GNU Social](https://gnu.io)) which presents a web interface much
like [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.twitter.com). Give it a try! If you don't have a pdgn.co email,
ask me on IRC and I can either give you one or otherwise setup your account. Like other Pdgn
services, it's named for a genus of pigeons. Goura is the genus of crowned pigeons. Here's a picture
of a western crowned pigeon!
