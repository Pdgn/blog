As a quick introduction, we're running a Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition campaign for Pdgn. After
each session, I'll be writing a post summarizing our adventure thus far. Our party is large
(currently ten people), but we anticipate that subsets of the group will participate in various
sessions. So, hopefully, it won't be too overwhelming. Each session, I'll include a list of players
and characters present.

Characters: John "Battle Boar" Ionescu (cSmith), Raz (ubuntor), Baern Lutgehr (Hyper), Vanswaxle
Fearless Pants (JacobEdelman), Lucifirius (Lucifirius), and Ez-Ra (The_Master)
