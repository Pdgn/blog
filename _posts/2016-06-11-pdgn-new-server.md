It is my pleasure to announce that a new server has been added to the PdgnCo network, Turtur.
Turtur is located in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany, and represents the first European server
in the network. As with other servers, the address uses the name as a subdomain. You can connect
directly at [turtur.pdgn.co](ircs://turtur.pdgn.co:6697) or via Hyperboria at
[h.turtur.pdgn.co](ircs://h.turtur.pdgn.co:6697). The server is named for the Turtur genus of
pigeons, containing five species of doves native to Sub-Saharan Africa. They're rather cute! Here
is a picture of an emerald-spotted wood dove, a member of the Turtur genus.
