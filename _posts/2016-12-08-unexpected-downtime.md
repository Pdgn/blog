As of 9:10 PM EST on December 8th 2016, Pdgn is currently experiencing unexpected downtime as the result of
a flood of bots joining the network. We are currently unaware of the reasons underlying this attack, but are
working to put software in place to prevent such attacks in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused. If you need to reach me for any reason, I'm currently on Freenode as aatxe. Pdgn will
be back as soon as possible.
  
Thanks for bearing with us,  
Aaron Weiss
